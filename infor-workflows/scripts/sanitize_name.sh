# Sanitize a string for safe use as a filename component.
#
# Rules:
#   1. Replace every run of non-alphanumeric characters with a single hyphen.
#   2. Trim leading and trailing hyphens.
#   3. Collapse multiple consecutive hyphens (handled by rule 1, but explicit).
#
# Preserves case so "Rogers" stays "Rogers", not "rogers".
#
# Usage:
#   SANITIZED=$(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-./infor-workflows}/scripts/sanitize_name.sh" "Rogers Communications Inc.")
#   # SANITIZED = "Rogers-Communications-Inc"
#
#   bash sanitize_name.sh "NasdaqGS:MSFT"   # -> NasdaqGS-MSFT
#   bash sanitize_name.sh "Dye & Durham"    # -> Dye-Durham
#   bash sanitize_name.sh "  spaces  "      # -> spaces
